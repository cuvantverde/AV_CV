		<h2> Summary </h2>
			<p>
			With a Master of Science in Project Management and a Professional Scrum Master certification, I am a Senior Project Associate at ALDI SÜD, where I manage and deliver complex projects using Waterfall and Agile methodologies. <br/>

I collaborate with stakeholders to align project requirements and objectives, and ensure project deliverables are aligned with business goals. I monitor project progress and identify and manage risks and issues to ensure successful project delivery. I communicate project status updates and risks to stakeholders and senior management.<br/>

In my previous roles, I led and managed project teams at Fullscreen Digital and Capgemini, providing expertise in project management tools and techniques, facilitating team meetings, and developing project documentation. I also participated in business development activities, such as proposal development, client presentations, and sales meetings.<br/>

I have a strong background in the hospitality industry, having completed my Bachelor of Arts in Arts, Entertainment, and Media Management at London South Bank University.<br/>

I am passionate about delivering high-quality results that meet the needs and expectations of the clients and the users. I am always eager to learn new skills and technologies, and to improve my project management processes and methodologies. I enjoy working with diverse and talented teams, and I value collaboration and problem-solving.<br/>
